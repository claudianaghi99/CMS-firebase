# CMS - Firebase

Integrate Firebase over the Employee CMS you've demoed.


- [x] Adding an employee should insert an employee into a Firebase DB
- [x] Populating the employee table should show all the Employees in the Firebase DB


- [x] Sorting, filtering and searching should also be done on the Firebase DB using the .filter and .sort tools provided by Firebase.

You can use either Realtime Database or  
- [x] Cloud Firestore.
For more info, read the Firebase Documentation.
