# CMS - Fire

Integrate Firebase over the Employee CMS you've demoed.


Adding an employee should insert an employee into a Firebase DB
Populating the employee table should show all the Employees in the Firebase DB


Sorting, filtering and searching should also be done on the Firebase DB using the .filter and .sort tools provided by Firebase.


You can use either Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore.
For more info, read the Firebase Documentation.
